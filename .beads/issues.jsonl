{"id":".claude-2uo","title":"Fix inter-agent data flow and bd handling issues","description":"Review identified 2 critical, 4 major, and 3 minor issues in workflow agents.\n\n## Critical\n1. Planner Input section lists file path as primary but Phase 1 says bd is primary - inconsistent\n2. Master describes what task IDs to pass but not HOW to pass them to agents\n\n## Major\n1. Inconsistent fallback behavior - Input sections contradict Phase 1 instructions across agents\n2. Analyst uses [own-task-id] for comments but [issue-id] for closing - unclear distinction\n3. No agent shows bd commit command - unclear if auto-commit or missing\n4. Master validation doesn't specify what constitutes valid output in bd comments\n\n## Minor\n1. Implementer bd comment is optional but master expects to validate output exists\n2. Inconsistent variable naming: [issue-id] vs [own-task-id] vs [task-id]\n3. Reviewer Phase 1 mixes comment-in-code-block format\n\n## Recommendations\n1. Add explicit handoff protocol to master.md with invocation syntax\n2. Standardize variable naming across all agents\n3. Update Input sections to match Phase 1 behavior\n4. Clarify implementer output expectations\n5. Document bd commit semantics","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"landovsky@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-28T15:42:47.103289+01:00","created_by":"Tomáš Landovský","updated_at":"2026-01-28T21:15:13.614972+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-28T21:15:13.614972+01:00","close_reason":"Fixed all 6 issues: bd show→bd comments, standardized Input sections, added invocation syntax, unified [task-id] naming, fixed reviewer formatting, added validation criteria","comments":[{"id":6,"issue_id":".claude-2uo","author":"Tomáš Landovský","text":"Blocked: Need to determine bd commit semantics before proceeding.
