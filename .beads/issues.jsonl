Planner Input section lists file path as primary but Phase 1 says bd is primary - inconsistent\n2. Master describes what task IDs to pass but not HOW to pass them to agents\n\n## Major\n1. Inconsistent fallback behavior - Input sections contradict Phase 1 instructions across agents\n2. Analyst uses [own-task-id] for comments but [issue-id] for closing - unclear distinction\n3. No agent shows bd commit command - unclear if auto-commit or missing\n4. Master validation doesn't specify what constitutes valid output in bd comments\n\n## Minor\n1. Implementer bd comment is optional but master expects to validate output exists\n2. Inconsistent variable naming: [issue-id] vs [own-task-id] vs [task-id]\n3. Reviewer Phase 1 mixes comment-in-code-block format\n\n## Recommendations\n1. Add explicit handoff protocol to master.md with invocation syntax\n2. Standardize variable naming across all agents\n3.
