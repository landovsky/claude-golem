We need to transform it into a globally callable command that auto-detects repository context from the current working directory, similar to how git commands work from any project directory.\n\nThe key insight is that the script should locate the ~/.claude/claude-sandbox installation directory (where Docker files live) independently from where it's called, while auto-detecting the target repository from the current directory's git configuration.\n\n### Branch\nfeature/global-sandbox-command\n\n### Key Patterns to Follow\n\n- /Users/tomas/.claude/commands/sandbox.md - Shows the intended auto-detection pattern (git remote discovery)\n- /Users/tomas/.claude/claude-sandbox/bin/claude-sandbox - Current implementation with path derivation (lines 25-27)\n- /Users/tomas/.claude/claude-sandbox/docs/docker-gotchas.md - Documents all lessons learned about the sandbox\n\n### Files to Change\n\n- /Users/tomas/.claude/claude-sandbox/bin/claude-sandbox - Main script path resolution and auto-detection logic\n- /Users/tomas/.claude/claude-sandbox/docker-compose.yml - Make database name configurable via environment variable\n- /Users/tomas/.claude/claude-sandbox/README.md - Update installation and usage documentation\n- /Users/tomas/.claude/claude-sandbox/entrypoint.sh - No changes needed (already uses REPO_URL from env)\n- /Users/tomas/.claude/claude-sandbox/.gitignore - Document .env file pattern for local config\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n#### 1. Path Resolution Strategy (bin/claude-sandbox)\n\nCurrent approach (lines 25-27):\n```bash\nSCRIPT_DIR=\"\\$(cd \\\"\\$(dirname \\\"\\${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\\\")\\\" \u0026\u0026 pwd)\"\nPROJECT_DIR=\"\\$(dirname \\\"\\$SCRIPT_DIR\\\")\"\nSANDBOX_DIR=\"\\$PROJECT_DIR\"\n```\n\nNew approach:\n```bash\n# Find the sandbox installation directory\n# Try: script's parent dir (backward compat), then ~/.claude/claude-sandbox (global install)\nSCRIPT_DIR=\"\\$(cd \\\"\\$(dirname \\\"\\${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\\\")\\\" \u0026\u0026 pwd)\"\nCANDIDATE_DIR=\"\\$(dirname \\\"\\$SCRIPT_DIR\\\")\"\n\nif [ -f \"\\$CANDIDATE_DIR/docker-compose.yml\" ]; then\n  # Called from bin/ subdirectory (backward compatible)\n  SANDBOX_DIR=\"\\$CANDIDATE_DIR\"\nelif [ -f \"\\$HOME/.claude/claude-sandbox/docker-compose.yml\" ]; then\n  # Global installation\n  SANDBOX_DIR=\"\\$HOME/.claude/claude-sandbox\"\nelse\n  error \"Cannot find claude-sandbox installation\"\n  error \"Expected docker-compose.yml in:\"\n  error \"  - \\$CANDIDATE_DIR\"\n  error \"  - \\$HOME/.claude/claude-sandbox\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n```\n\n#### 2. Auto-Detection Logic (bin/claude-sandbox)\n\nAdd after path resolution, before check_env():\n\n```bash\n# Auto-detect REPO_URL from current directory if not set\nauto_detect_repo() {\n  if [ -n \"\\$REPO_URL\" ]; then\n    # Explicitly set, don't override\n    return 0\n  fi\n\n  # Try to get git remote from current directory\n  local detected_url=\\$(git -C \"\\$PWD\" remote get-url origin 2\u003e/dev/null)\n  if [ -z \"\\$detected_url\" ]; then\n    error \"REPO_URL not set and cannot auto-detect from current directory\"\n    error \"Either:\"\n    error \"  1. Run from a git repository with origin remote, or\"\n    error \"  2. Set REPO_URL environment variable\"\n    return 1\n  fi\n\n  export REPO_URL=\"\\$detected_url\"\n  log \"Auto-detected REPO_URL: \\$REPO_URL\"\n}\n\n# Auto-detect REPO_BRANCH from current directory if not set\nauto_detect_branch() {\n  if [ -n \"\\$REPO_BRANCH\" ]; then\n    # Explicitly set, don't override\n    return 0\n  fi\n\n  # Try to get current branch from current directory\n  local detected_branch=\\$(git -C \"\\$PWD\" branch --show-current 2\u003e/dev/null)\n  if [ -n \"\\$detected_branch\" ]; then\n    export REPO_BRANCH=\"\\$detected_branch\"\n    log \"Auto-detected REPO_BRANCH: \\$REPO_BRANCH\"\n  else\n    # Default to main (already handled by entrypoint.sh default)\n    log \"Using default branch: main\"\n  fi\n}\n```\n\nModify check_env() to call auto-detection BEFORE validating REPO_URL:\n\n```bash\ncheck_env() {\n  local missing=0\n\n  # Auto-detect repository context\n  auto_detect_repo || missing=1\n  auto_detect_branch\n\n  # Required vars (REPO_URL may have been auto-detected)\n  for var in GITHUB_TOKEN REPO_URL; do\n    if [ -z \"\\${!var}\" ]; then\n      error \"Missing required environment variable: \\$var\"\n      missing=1\n    fi\n  done\n  # ... rest of check_env\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Database Name Configuration (docker-compose.yml)\n\nCurrent (line 15, 41):\n```yaml\nPOSTGRES_DB: hriste_development\nDATABASE_URL: postgis://claude:claude@postgres:5432/hriste_development\n```\n\nNew:\n```yaml\nPOSTGRES_DB: \\${DATABASE_NAME:-sandbox_development}\nDATABASE_URL: postgis://claude:claude@postgres:5432/\\${DATABASE_NAME:-sandbox_development}\n```\n\n#### 4. Documentation Updates (README.md)\n\nAdd new section after \"Quick Start\":\n\n```markdown\n## Global Installation\n\nTo use claude-sandbox from any directory:\n\n### Option 1: Add to PATH\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc\nexport PATH=\\\"\\$HOME/.claude/claude-sandbox/bin:\\$PATH\\\"\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### Option 2: Symlink to Local Bin\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nln -s ~/.claude/claude-sandbox/bin/claude-sandbox ~/.local/bin/claude-sandbox\n# Ensure ~/.local/bin is in PATH\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### Auto-Detection\n\nWhen called from within a git repository, claude-sandbox will automatically detect:\n- REPO_URL: From git remote get-url origin\n- REPO_BRANCH: From git branch --show-current\n\nThese can still be overridden with environment variables.\n\nExample:\n\\`\\`\\`bash\ncd ~/projects/my-app\n# No need to set REPO_URL or REPO_BRANCH\nclaude-sandbox local \"fix the login bug\"\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nOverride auto-detection:\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nREPO_URL=\"https://github.com/other/repo.git\" \\\\\nREPO_BRANCH=\"develop\" \\\\\nclaude-sandbox local \"work on feature X\"\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\nUpdate environment variables table to show auto-detection:\n\n```markdown\n| Variable | Default | Description |\n|----------|---------|-------------|\n| REPO_URL | Auto-detected from git | Repository URL (auto-detected from git remote get-url origin) |\n| REPO_BRANCH | Auto-detected or main | Branch to clone (auto-detected from git branch --show-current) |\n| DATABASE_NAME | sandbox_development | PostgreSQL database name |\n```\n\n#### 5. .gitignore Pattern\n\nAdd to /Users/tomas/.claude/claude-sandbox/.gitignore:\n\n```gitignore\n# Local environment overrides\n.env\n.env.local\n```\n\n### Watch Out For\n\n- Backward Compatibility: The script must continue to work when called as bin/claude-sandbox from the project directory. The path resolution tries the backward-compatible path FIRST before falling back to global installation.\n\n- PATH Inheritance: When using cd \\$SANDBOX_DIR (line 109, 173), ensure we're switching to the sandbox installation directory, not the caller's working directory. This is critical for docker compose to find docker-compose.yml.\n\n- Git Command Context: When auto-detecting from current directory, use git -C \\\"\\$PWD\\\" to explicitly specify the working directory, not the sandbox installation directory.\n\n- Environment Variable Precedence: Auto-detection should be a fallback only. Explicitly set env vars (from .env, direnv, or manual export) should always take precedence over auto-detection.\n\n- Database Volume Isolation: Different projects might want different database instances. The configurable DATABASE_NAME allows this, but volumes are named based on the compose file location. Consider documenting that different database names share the same postgres volume (data is isolated by database name, not volume).\n\n### Dependencies to Be Careful With\n\n- docker-compose.yml location: The cd \\$SANDBOX_DIR commands throughout the script depend on finding this file. The new path resolution MUST validate this file exists before proceeding.\n\n- Git availability: Auto-detection requires git command. Should fail gracefully if git is not installed or current directory isn't a git repo.\n\n- envsubst for k8s (line 164): This already reads from environment, so auto-detected values will work correctly.\n\n- Build script path copying (line 176-193): Uses \\$HOME/.claude/agents as source - this is independent of caller's directory, so no changes needed.\n\n### Testing Approach\n\nManual testing checklist:\n\n1. Backward compatibility - Call from project directory:\n   cd ~/.claude/claude-sandbox\n   bin/claude-sandbox build\n   bin/claude-sandbox local \"test task\"\n\n2. Global with PATH:\n   export PATH=\"\\$HOME/.claude/claude-sandbox/bin:\\$PATH\"\n   cd ~/projects/some-repo\n   claude-sandbox local \"test task\"\n\n3. Global with symlink:\n   ln -sf ~/.claude/claude-sandbox/bin/claude-sandbox ~/.local/bin/\n   cd ~/projects/some-repo\n   claude-sandbox local \"test task\"\n\n4. Auto-detection override:\n   cd ~/projects/repo-a\n   REPO_URL=\"https://github.com/user/repo-b.git\" claude-sandbox local \"test\"\n   # Should use repo-b, not repo-a\n\n5. Error cases:\n   - Call from non-git directory (no origin)\n   - Call with missing GITHUB_TOKEN\n   - Call with missing docker-compose.yml\n   - Call from directory without git installed\n\n6. Database name configuration:\n   DATABASE_NAME=\"my_project_dev\" claude-sandbox local \"test\"\n   # Verify postgres created \"my_project_dev\" database\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Detached HEAD state: git branch --show-current returns empty. Script should fall back to default main (already handled by entrypoint.sh default).\n\n- Multiple remotes: Script uses origin specifically. If a repo has multiple remotes but no origin, auto-detection fails (acceptable - user can set REPO_URL manually).\n\n- SSH vs HTTPS URLs: Git remote can return git@github.com:user/repo.git or https://github.com/user/repo.git. Entrypoint.sh (line 54) already handles HTTPS conversion for authentication, so we can accept both formats.\n\n- Relative paths: If someone sets SANDBOX_DIR manually, ensure all paths are absolute by using \\$(cd ... \u0026\u0026 pwd) pattern.\n\n### Success Criteria\n\nAfter implementation:\n1. Can run claude-sandbox from any directory when in PATH\n2. Auto-detects REPO_URL from git remote origin\n3. Auto-detects REPO_BRANCH from current branch\n4. Database name is configurable via DATABASE_NAME env var\n5. Still works when called as bin/claude-sandbox from installation directory\n6. Explicitly set env vars override auto-detection\n7. Clear error messages when auto-detection fails\n8.

Instead of looking up the task with `bd show .claude-muf`, Claude treats it as a file path and looks for a literal file named `.claude-muf` in the workspace.\n\n**Symptom**: Claude says \"The file `.claude-muf` doesn't exist in the workspace\" and searches for files with similar names.\n\n**Expected**: Claude should recognize `.claude-muf` as a beads task ID and run `bd show .claude-muf` or `bd comments .claude-muf` to retrieve the task.\n\n**Verified**: The task `.claude-muf` exists in `.beads/issues.jsonl` with title \"Move lessons-learned.md to artifacts directory\".\n\n## Missing Information\n\n- What exact prompt does Claude receive inside the container? (Need to verify the TASK variable reaches Claude correctly)\n- Does the sandbox have `bd` available in PATH?\n- Does the sandbox have the `.beads/` directory with the issues.jsonl file?\n- What instructions does the `/develop` command give Claude about task ID resolution?\n\n## Hypotheses\n\n### Hypothesis 1: The `.beads/` directory is not cloned into the sandbox workspace\n\n**Likelihood:** High\n\n**Theory:** The sandbox clones the repository fresh from the remote. If `.beads/` or `.beads/issues.jsonl` is gitignored or not pushed to the remote, the sandboxed Claude won't have access to the task database, so `bd` commands won't find any tasks.\n\n**Supporting evidence:**\n- The `.beads/` directory typically contains local database state\n- `.beads/config.yaml` and `.beads/issues.jsonl` may be gitignored in some setups\n- The sandbox log shows \"HEAD is now at 1e37439\" suggesting a clean checkout\n- Claude's response shows it searched for files but found none matching `.claude-muf`\n\n**Contradicting evidence:**\n- User says they \"verified that bd list contains this task in container's workspace/ directory\" (but this verification method is unclear)\n\n**How to test:**\n1. Check if `.beads/` is in the remote repository:\n   ```bash\n   git ls-tree -r HEAD --name-only | grep -E \"^\\.beads/\"\n   ```\n2. SSH into the running container or check the workspace volume:\n   ```bash\n   docker exec -it \u003ccontainer\u003e ls -la /workspace/.beads/\n   docker exec -it \u003ccontainer\u003e bd list\n   ```\n3. Check the repo's `.gitignore` for `.beads/` patterns\n\n**If confirmed, offer to:**\n- Fix the `.gitignore` to include `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n- Or create a sync mechanism to copy `.beads/` into the sandbox\n\n---\n\n### Hypothesis 2: The `/develop` command doesn't instruct Claude how to interpret task IDs\n\n**Likelihood:** High\n\n**Theory:** The `/develop` command in `commands/develop.md` documents `bd` commands but doesn't explicitly tell Claude that arguments starting with `.claude-` are task IDs that should be looked up with `bd show`. Claude sees the literal string `.claude-muf` and interprets it as a file path because nothing tells it otherwise.\n\n**Supporting evidence:**\n- Looking at `develop.md`, the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder passes the raw argument but there's no instruction saying \"if ARGUMENTS starts with `.claude-`, treat it as a task ID\"\n- The Phase 1 \"Assess the Request\" section doesn't mention parsing task IDs from the input\n- Claude's behavior (looking for a file) matches what happens when it receives an unfamiliar token without context\n\n**Contradicting evidence:**\n- The develop.md extensively documents `bd` commands, so Claude might infer task ID syntax\n- `.claude-xxx` prefix is distinctive and could be recognized as a beads ID\n\n**How to test:**\n1. Check if `develop.md` has any instruction for task ID parsing:\n   ```bash\n   grep -i \"task.*id\\|\\.claude-\\|argument\\|parse\" commands/develop.md\n   ```\n2. Test locally with a verbose run to see what prompt Claude receives\n3. Add explicit instruction to `develop.md` and see if behavior changes\n\n**If confirmed, offer to:**\n- Add a section to `develop.md` explaining how to parse task ID arguments\n- Example: \"If ARGUMENTS matches `.claude-XXX` pattern, retrieve the task with `bd show [id]`\"\n\n---\n\n### Hypothesis 3: `bd` CLI is not installed or not in PATH inside the sandbox container\n\n**Likelihood:** Medium\n\n**Theory:** The sandbox container builds from a Dockerfile that may not include the `bd` binary. Even if the `.beads/` directory exists, Claude can't query it without the `bd` CLI tool.\n\n**Supporting evidence:**\n- The Dockerfile and entrypoint.sh don't show `bd` installation\n- `bd` is a relatively new tool that wouldn't be in standard base images\n\n**Contradicting evidence:**\n- The `/develop` command references `bd` commands extensively, suggesting it should be available\n- User claims they verified `bd list` works in the container\n\n**How to test:**\n1. Check if `bd` is available in the container:\n   ```bash\n   docker exec -it \u003ccontainer\u003e which bd\n   docker exec -it \u003ccontainer\u003e bd --version\n   ```\n2. Check the Dockerfile for `bd` installation steps\n3. Try running `bd list` inside a fresh container\n\n**If confirmed, offer to:**\n- Add `bd` installation to the Dockerfile\n- Create a task using /bd-task\n\n---\n\n### Hypothesis 4: The task argument is being passed but Claude doesn't trigger the `/develop` skill\n\n**Likelihood:** Medium\n\n**Theory:** When the task is `\"/develop .claude-muf\"`, Claude may not recognize this as invoking the `/develop` skill/command. The entrypoint passes `$TASK` directly to `claude -p \"$TASK\"`, and if Claude doesn't interpret leading `/develop` as a skill invocation, it treats the whole string as a natural language request.\n\n**Supporting evidence:**\n- The sandbox output says `[sandbox] Task: print task description .claude-muf` for the test run, which is different from `/develop .claude-muf`\n- Claude's response was to look for a file, not to run the develop workflow\n- The skill invocation mechanism may require specific formatting or context\n\n**Contradicting evidence:**\n- The example uses `\"/develop .claude-muf\"` which should trigger the skill\n- Skill tool documentation says `/\u003cskill-name\u003e` should invoke skills\n\n**How to test:**\n1. Run the sandbox with explicit `/develop` prefix and check Claude's interpretation:\n   ```bash\n   claude-sandbox local \"/develop .claude-muf\"\n   ```\n2. Check Claude's first action - does it invoke the develop skill or treat it as text?\n3. Try running without the slash: `claude-sandbox local \"develop .claude-muf\"`\n\n**If confirmed, offer to:**\n- Investigate how skills are invoked in non-interactive `-p` mode\n- Update entrypoint or task passing mechanism\n\n---\n\n### Hypothesis 5: The beads task database path differs between host and container\n\n**Likelihood:** Low\n\n**Theory:** `bd` may be looking for tasks in a different location than where `.beads/issues.jsonl` exists. The database path could be configured differently inside the container vs the host.\n\n**Supporting evidence:**\n- `bd` can use SQLite database or JSONL file based on config\n- Container environment may have different `BEADS_DB` or working directory\n\n**Contradicting evidence:**\n- `bd` auto-discovers `.beads/` in the current directory by default\n- User verified `bd list` works in container\n\n**How to test:**\n1. Inside the container, check `bd` configuration:\n   ```bash\n   docker exec -it \u003ccontainer\u003e bd config\n   docker exec -it \u003ccontainer\u003e pwd\n   docker exec -it \u003ccontainer\u003e ls -la .beads/\n   ```\n\n**If confirmed, offer to:**\n- Set explicit `BEADS_DB` environment variable in docker-compose.yml\n\n## Recommended Investigation Order\n\n1. **Hypothesis 1 (High)**: Check if `.beads/issues.jsonl` is in the remote repo and cloned into the workspace. This is most likely the root cause since sandboxes start fresh from git.\n\n2. **Hypothesis 2 (High)**: Review `develop.md` for task ID parsing instructions. Even if `.beads/` exists, Claude needs to know to use `bd show` on task IDs.\n\n3. **Hypothesis 4 (Medium)**: Verify that `/develop` skill is being invoked properly in `-p` mode. The test output shows a different task string which suggests skill invocation may not be happening.\n\n4. **Hypothesis 3 (Medium)**: Confirm `bd` is installed in the container. Quick check.\n\n5. **Hypothesis 5 (Low)**: Only if others are ruled out.\n\n## Quick Wins\n\n1. **Verify .beads/ in git**:\n   ```bash\n   git ls-tree -r HEAD --name-only | grep beads\n   cat .gitignore | grep beads\n   ```\n\n2. **Add explicit task ID instruction to develop.md**:\n   Add after `$ARGUMENTS`:\n   ```markdown\n   If the argument matches pattern `.claude-XXX`, it's a beads task ID. Retrieve it with:\n   ```bash\n   bd show [task-id]\n   ```\n   ```\n\n3. **Test bd availability in container**:\n   ```bash\n   docker run --rm claude-sandbox:latest which bd\n   ```\n\n## Need More Info?\n\nIf the hypotheses don't pan out:\n\n1. Add verbose logging to entrypoint.sh to see exact prompt passed to Claude\n2. Enable Claude's `--verbose` output and capture full reasoning\n3. Check if there's a difference between local Claude Code and sandboxed behavior for the same task\n4.

Each review creates a JSON datapoint stored as a bd comment on a dedicated tracking task. Supports concurrent writes and dynamic category addition.\n\n## Requirements\n- [ ] Create a dedicated bd task for storing tracking data (e.g., `.claude-metrics` or similar)\n- [ ] Reviewer agent emits a JSON payload after each review\n- [ ] Payload includes timestamp, task ID, severity counts, and category breakdown\n- [ ] Support these severity levels: Critical, Major, Minor\n- [ ] Support these base categories: Testing, UI/UX, Business Logic, Security, Performance, Code Quality, Documentation, Hints, Configuration\n- [ ] Allow reviewer to add new categories dynamically when an issue doesn't fit existing ones\n- [ ] Each tracking entry is a separate bd comment (append-only, concurrent-safe)\n- [ ] Zero-issue reviews still emit a datapoint (with all counts at 0)\n\n## Data Schema\n\nEach review emits one JSON payload as a bd comment:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"v\": 1,\n  \"ts\": \"2026-01-30T17:30:00Z\",\n  \"task\": \".claude-abc.4\",\n  \"parent\": \".claude-abc\",\n  \"severity\": {\n    \"critical\": 0,\n    \"major\": 2,\n    \"minor\": 3\n  },\n  \"categories\": {\n    \"testing\": 1,\n    \"business_logic\": 2,\n    \"code_quality\": 2\n  },\n  \"issues\": [\n    {\n      \"severity\": \"major\",\n      \"category\": \"testing\",\n      \"file\": \"src/auth.ts\",\n      \"line\": 42,\n      \"summary\": \"Missing error case test\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Field definitions:\n- `v`: Schema version (integer, start at 1)\n- `ts`: ISO 8601 timestamp when review completed\n- `task`: The reviewer subtask ID (e.g., `.claude-abc.4`)\n- `parent`: The parent task being reviewed\n- `severity`: Counts per severity level (all three keys always present)\n- `categories`: Counts per category (only categories with issues \u003e 0 included)\n- `issues`: Array of individual issues (optional, for detailed analysis)\n\n### Category keys (snake_case):\n- `testing` - Missing/inadequate tests\n- `ui_ux` - Frontend/interface issues\n- `business_logic` - Incorrect behavior\n- `security` - Vulnerabilities\n- `performance` - Efficiency issues\n- `code_quality` - Structure, naming, patterns\n- `documentation` - Missing/incorrect docs\n- `hints` - Missing hints/guidance\n- `configuration` - Config issues\n- `[new_category]` - Reviewer may add as needed\n\n## Storage mechanism\n\n### Dedicated tracking task\n1. Create task once: `bd create \"Review metrics tracking\" --id .claude-metrics`\n2. Task remains open indefinitely as a data store\n3. Each review appends: `bd comments add .claude-metrics \"[JSON payload]\"`\n\n### Concurrent write safety\n- bd comments are append-only\n- Each reviewer writes its own comment with its own timestamp\n- No read-modify-write cycle, so no race conditions\n- Git merges handle concurrent pushes naturally\n\n### Data retrieval\nConsuming tool reads all comments:\n```bash\nbd comments .claude-metrics\n```\nThen parses each comment as JSON, aggregates as needed.\n\n## Edge cases\n- [ ] Review finds zero issues: Emit payload with all severity counts = 0, empty categories object, empty issues array\n- [ ] Issue doesn't fit existing category: Reviewer adds new category key (snake_case), documents in issues[].summary why new category was needed\n- [ ] Malformed JSON: Consuming tool skips invalid entries, logs warning\n- [ ] Very long review (many issues): Keep issues array, schema handles arbitrary length\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Dedicated `.claude-metrics` task exists and persists across sessions\n- [ ] Reviewer agent emits valid JSON payload after every review\n- [ ] Payload conforms to schema (v, ts, task, parent, severity, categories all present)\n- [ ] Multiple concurrent reviews can write without conflicts\n- [ ] `bd comments .claude-metrics` returns parseable JSON entries\n- [ ] Zero-issue reviews produce valid datapoints\n\n## Out of scope\n- Aggregation logic (separate reporting tool handles this)\n- Visualization (separate tool)\n- Historical data migration (start fresh)\n- Category standardization enforcement (reviewer uses judgment)\n- Automatic metrics task creation (manual one-time setup is fine)\n\n## Artifacts consulted\n- `workflow-design/WORKFLOW.md`: Confirmed reviewer role, severity definitions, bd comments pattern\n\n## Artifacts to update\n- `agents/reviewer.md`: Add Phase 5.5 or modify Phase 7 to emit tracking payload\n\n## Open risks\n- bd comment size limits unknown - if hit, could truncate issues array (keep severity/category counts as minimum viable payload)\n- Long-running metrics task may accumulate thousands of comments - consuming tool should handle pagination if bd provides it","created_at":"2026-01-30T16:47:01Z"}]}
