Inconsistent fallback behavior - Input sections contradict Phase 1 instructions across agents\n2. Analyst uses [own-task-id] for comments but [issue-id] for closing - unclear distinction\n3. No agent shows bd commit command - unclear if auto-commit or missing\n4. Master validation doesn't specify what constitutes valid output in bd comments\n\n## Minor\n1.

The greeting utility already exists and all tests pass. The implementer's job is to verify the existing code meets requirements and ensure their stage completion generates metrics events for validation. No new code needs to be written.\n\n## Current State (Verified by Analyst)\n- `/Users/tomas/.claude/utils/greeting.js` - Working implementation with `generateGreeting(name)` function\n- `/Users/tomas/.claude/utils/greeting.test.js` - 5 passing test cases covering all edge cases\n- `/Users/tomas/.claude/.claude/hooks/metrics-start.sh` - Stage start event capture (Phase 1 complete)\n- `/Users/tomas/.claude/.claude/hooks/metrics-end.sh` - Stage end event capture with tokens/cost (Phase 2 complete)\n- `/Users/tomas/.claude/workflow-metrics.jsonl` - Metrics storage (active, contains prior test runs)\n\n## What the Implementer Should Do\n\n### 1. Verify Existing Implementation\n- [ ] Run `node /Users/tomas/.claude/utils/greeting.test.js` to confirm all 5 tests pass\n- [ ] Review `/Users/tomas/.claude/utils/greeting.js` to confirm it meets the simple requirements:\n  - Returns \"Hello, [name]!\" for valid names\n  - Returns \"Hello, Guest!\" for null/empty/undefined\n- [ ] Verify implementation is simple and correct (no changes needed)\n\n### 2. Complete Stage to Generate Metrics\n- [ ] Close implementer subtask `.claude-790.3` to trigger metrics-end.sh hook\n- [ ] The hook will automatically:\n  - Write stage_end event to workflow-metrics.jsonl\n  - Post Stage Metrics comment to `.claude-790.3`\n  - Include token usage, cost, duration from this session\n\n### 3. No Code Changes Required\nThe analyst explicitly noted: \"No new code needs to be written - greeting utility already exists.\" The implementer should NOT modify any code unless they find a genuine bug (none expected).\n\n## Files to Verify (Not Change)\n- `/Users/tomas/.claude/utils/greeting.js` - Utility function (already correct)\n- `/Users/tomas/.claude/utils/greeting.test.js` - Test suite (already passing)\n\n## Watch Out For\n\n### Don't Overthink This\nThis task is intentionally simple. The real work happened in `.claude-l0a` (Phase 1 metrics) and `.claude-6t5` (Phase 2 tokens). This task exercises the infrastructure, not builds new features.\n\n### The $TASK Environment Variable\nThe hooks depend on `$TASK` being set by master. If you see \"unknown-task\" in metrics, that's a master-level issue, not an implementer concern. The analyst flagged this as a known risk.\n\n### Metrics are Automatic\nYou don't need to manually trigger metrics collection. The SubagentStop hook fires automatically when you close your subtask. Just close normally and the metrics will flow.\n\n## Testing Approach\nNo unit tests needed - tests already exist and pass. Validation is:\n1. Run existing tests to confirm they pass (they will)\n2. Close implementer subtask to generate stage_end metrics event\n3. Reviewer will verify metrics were recorded correctly\n\n## Edge Cases (Already Handled)\nThe analyst confirmed these are all already implemented:\n- Name is null → Returns \"Hello, Guest!\" ✓\n- Name is empty string → Returns \"Hello, Guest!\" ✓  \n- Name is undefined → Returns \"Hello, Guest!\" ✓\n- Name is \"Alice\" → Returns \"Hello, Alice!\" ✓\n\n## Documentation to Update\nNone. The analyst's spec explicitly states \"No documentation updates needed.\"\n\n## Artifacts to Update\nNone. The analyst's spec explicitly states \"None required.\"\n\n## Lessons from Past Work\n\n### From .claude-l0a (Phase 1 Metrics)\n- Hook scripts use `set +e` and `|| true` to never break workflow - this pattern is already applied in metrics-start.sh and metrics-end.sh\n- jq with `--arg` prevents injection - already used correctly in both hooks\n- Exit 0 always pattern - already implemented\n\n### From .claude-6t5 (Phase 2 Tokens)\n- grep + jq pipeline for JSONL parsing is efficient - already in metrics-end.sh lines 79-89\n- awk for floating-point cost calculation - already in metrics-end.sh lines 115-125\n- Transcript parsing is defensive with fallbacks - already implemented\n\n### From .claude-9nr (Inter-Stage Data Passing)\n- bd comments are primary data transport - this plan is posted as bd comment per that pattern\n- When tool changes happen, verify agent has access - the implementer has Bash tool for running tests\n\n## What Success Looks Like\n1. Tests pass when you run them (proving code works)\n2. You close your subtask without blocking\n3. Metrics-end.sh writes a stage_end event to workflow-metrics.jsonl with your agent_id, tokens, cost, and duration\n4. You receive a Stage Metrics comment on your subtask showing the data\n5. Reviewer verifies the metrics infrastructure worked end-to-end\n\n## Key Insight\nThis task is validating infrastructure, not building features. The greeting utility is a trivial excuse to exercise the full workflow (analyst → planner → implementer → reviewer). Each stage generates metrics. That's the real deliverable - proving the hooks work across all stages.","created_at":"2026-02-04T10:05:36.783358+01:00"}]}

{"id":".claude-l86.2","title":"Plan implementation","notes":"# PostGIS Support - Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\nThis plan breaks down the implementation of PostGIS support into discrete, testable steps. Based on the analysis in `postgis-support-spec.md`, we'll implement changes to K8s templates and entrypoint script.\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n**Approach**: Use PostGIS image everywhere (backward compatible, simpler)\n\n### Why This Approach?\n1. PostGIS is a PostgreSQL extension - 100% backward compatible\n2. Docker Compose already uses this approach successfully\n3. No conditional logic needed in K8s templates\n4. Projects without PostGIS work fine with PostGIS image\n5. Simpler to maintain and test\n\n## Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n### Step 1: Update K8s Job Template\n\n**File**: `claude-sandbox/k8s/job-template.yaml`\n\n**Changes**:\n\n1. **Update Postgres sidecar image** (line 96):\n   ```yaml\n   # Before:\n   image: postgres:16-alpine\n\n   # After:\n   image: postgis/postgis:16-3.4-alpine\n   ```\n\n2. **Update DATABASE_URL scheme** (line 67):\n   ```yaml\n   # Before:\n   value: \"postgres://claude:claude@localhost:5432/${DATABASE_NAME:-sandbox_development}\"\n\n   # After:\n   value: \"postgis://claude:claude@localhost:5432/${DATABASE_NAME:-sandbox_development}\"\n   ```\n\n**Verification**:\n- [ ] Image name changed to postgis/postgis\n- [ ] Version matches docker-compose.yml (16-3.4-alpine)\n- [ ] DATABASE_URL uses postgis:// scheme\n- [ ] Variable interpolation preserved: ${DATABASE_NAME:-sandbox_development}\n\n### Step 2: Add Database Readiness Check\n\n**File**: `claude-sandbox/entrypoint.sh`\n\n**Location**: Before Rails database operations (before line 216)\n\n**Implementation**:\n\n```bash\n# Wait for database to be ready if Rails project with database\nif [ \"$HAS_RAILS\" = true ]; then\n  section \"Database Setup\"\n\n  # Check if DATABASE_URL is set (indicates we need database)\n  if [ -n \"$DATABASE_URL\" ]; then\n    action \"Waiting for database to be ready...\"\n\n    # Extract connection details from DATABASE_URL\n    # Supports both postgres:// and postgis:// schemes\n    DB_HOST=$(echo \"$DATABASE_URL\" | sed -E 's|^[^:]+://[^@]+@([^:]+):.*|\\1|')\n    DB_PORT=$(echo \"$DATABASE_URL\" | sed -E 's|^[^:]+://[^@]+@[^:]+:([0-9]+)/.*|\\1|')\n    DB_USER=$(echo \"$DATABASE_URL\" | sed -E 's|^[^:]+://([^:]+):.*|\\1|')\n\n    # Wait up to 30 seconds for database\n    for i in $(seq 1 30); do\n      if pg_isready -h \"$DB_HOST\" -p \"$DB_PORT\" -U \"$DB_USER\" \u003e /dev/null 2\u003e\u00261; then\n        success \"Database is ready\"\n        break\n      fi\n      if [ $i -eq 30 ]; then\n        error \"Database failed to become ready after 30 seconds\"\n        exit 1\n      fi\n      sleep 1\n    done\n  fi\n\n  action \"Preparing Rails database...\"\n  bundle exec rails db:prepare || bundle exec rails db:setup\n  success \"Database ready\"\n  separator\nfi\n```\n\n**Key Points**:\n- Uses `pg_isready` tool (already available in PostgreSQL)\n- Extracts host/port/user from DATABASE_URL (works with both schemes)\n- 30 second timeout with proper error handling\n- Only runs if Rails project detected and DATABASE_URL set\n- Uses `$(seq 1 30)` instead of bash-specific `{1..30}` for POSIX compatibility\n\n**Verification**:\n- [ ] Readiness check added before db:prepare\n- [ ] Extracts connection details correctly\n- [ ] 30 second timeout implemented\n- [ ] Proper error handling on timeout\n- [ ] Success message on ready\n\n### Step 3: Add Redis Readiness Check (Optional)\n\n**File**: `claude-sandbox/entrypoint.sh`\n\n**Location**: Before Redis operations (if any exist in the future)\n\n**Implementation**:\n\n```bash\n# Wait for Redis to be ready if REDIS_URL is set\nif [ -n \"$REDIS_URL\" ]; then\n  action \"Waiting for Redis to be ready...\"\n\n  # Extract host and port from REDIS_URL\n  REDIS_HOST=$(echo \"$REDIS_URL\" | sed -E 's|^redis://([^:]+):.*|\\1|')\n  REDIS_PORT=$(echo \"$REDIS_URL\" | sed -E 's|^redis://[^:]+:([0-9]+).*|\\1|')\n\n  # Wait up to 30 seconds for Redis\n  for i in $(seq 1 30); do\n    if redis-cli -h \"$REDIS_HOST\" -p \"$REDIS_PORT\" ping \u003e /dev/null 2\u003e\u00261; then\n      success \"Redis is ready\"\n      break\n    fi\n    if [ $i -eq 30 ]; then\n      error \"Redis failed to become ready after 30 seconds\"\n      exit 1\n    fi\n    sleep 1\n  done\nfi\n```\n\n**Note**: This is preparatory work for future Redis-dependent operations. Currently Rails doesn't require Redis to be ready for db:prepare.\n\n**Verification**:\n- [ ] Redis check added (conditional on REDIS_URL)\n- [ ] Connection details extracted correctly\n- [ ] 30 second timeout implemented\n- [ ] Proper error handling\n\n### Step 4: Add Database Adapter Detection (Informational)\n\n**File**: `claude-sandbox/entrypoint.sh`\n\n**Location**: After Rails detection (after line 151)\n\n**Implementation**:\n\n```bash\n# Detect database adapter if Rails project\nDB_ADAPTER=\"\"\nif [ \"$HAS_RAILS\" = true ] \u0026\u0026 [ -f \"config/database.yml\" ]; then\n  if grep -qE '^\\s*adapter:\\s*postgis' config/database.yml; then\n    DB_ADAPTER=\"postgis\"\n    info \"Database adapter: PostGIS\"\n  elif grep -qE '^\\s*adapter:\\s*(postgresql|postgres)' config/database.yml; then\n    DB_ADAPTER=\"postgresql\"\n    info \"Database adapter: PostgreSQL\"\n  elif grep -qE '^\\s*adapter:\\s*mysql2?' config/database.yml; then\n    DB_ADAPTER=\"mysql\"\n    info \"Database adapter: MySQL\"\n  fi\nfi\n```\n\n**Purpose**:\n- Informational logging only\n- Helps debugging database issues\n- No conditional behavior based on adapter\n\n**Verification**:\n- [ ] Detection added after Rails detection\n- [ ] Logs adapter type if found\n- [ ] Handles postgis, postgresql, mysql adapters\n- [ ] Doesn't break if database.yml missing\n\n### Step 5: Update Documentation\n\n**Files**:\n- `claude-sandbox/README.md`\n- `claude-sandbox/k8s/TESTING.md`\n\n**Changes**:\n\n1. **README.md** - Update \"Pending\" section:\n   ```markdown\n   \u003e **Working:**\n   \u003e - ✅ Basic job execution\n   \u003e - ✅ SOPS encrypted secrets\n   \u003e - ✅ .env.claude plaintext config\n   \u003e - ✅ REPO_URL auto-detection\n   \u003e - ✅ Parallel deployments\n   \u003e - ✅ PostGIS support (backward compatible)\n   \u003e - ✅ Database readiness checks\n   \u003e - ✅ Redis readiness checks\n   \u003e\n   \u003e **Pending:**\n   \u003e - ⏳ Test with Redis-dependent operations\n   \u003e - ⏳ Full production testing\n   ```\n\n2. **TESTING.md** - Add PostGIS test case:\n   ```markdown\n   ### PostGIS Projects\n   - [ ] Test with project using adapter: postgis\n   - [ ] Test with project using adapter: postgresql\n   - [ ] Verify PostGIS extensions available\n   - [ ] Verify non-PostGIS projects still work\n   ```\n\n## Testing Plan\n\n### Unit Tests (Manual Verification)\n\n1. **URL Parsing Test**:\n   ```bash\n   # Test DATABASE_URL parsing\n   export DATABASE_URL=\"postgis://user:pass@dbhost:5432/mydb\"\n   DB_HOST=$(echo \"$DATABASE_URL\" | sed -E 's|^[^:]+://[^@]+@([^:]+):.*|\\1|')\n   echo \"$DB_HOST\"  # Should output: dbhost\n   ```\n\n2. **Adapter Detection Test**:\n   ```bash\n   # Create test database.yml with different adapters\n   # Verify grep patterns match correctly\n   ```\n\n### Integration Tests\n\n1. **Local Docker Compose**:\n   - Already using PostGIS ✅\n   - Test with hriste project (postgis adapter)\n   - Test with non-PostGIS Rails project\n\n2. **K8s Deployment**:\n   - Deploy job with PostGIS project\n   - Verify logs show \"Database is ready\"\n   - Verify Rails db:prepare succeeds\n   - Check database has PostGIS extensions: `SELECT PostGIS_Version();`\n\n3. **Backward Compatibility**:\n   - Deploy job with non-PostGIS Rails project\n   - Verify everything works as before\n   - Verify no PostGIS errors in logs\n\n### Test Projects\n\n1. **With PostGIS**: hriste project (adapter: postgis)\n2. **Without PostGIS**: Generic Rails project (adapter: postgresql)\n3. **Edge Case**: Rails project with no database.yml\n\n## Rollout Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: K8s Template Update\n- Update job-template.yaml\n- Test with single project\n- Monitor for issues\n\n### Phase 2: Readiness Checks\n- Add database readiness check\n- Test timeout scenarios\n- Test parallel deployments\n\n### Phase 3: Optional Enhancements\n- Add Redis readiness check\n- Add adapter detection logging\n- Update documentation\n\n### Phase 4: Production Validation\n- Test with multiple projects\n- Monitor performance impact\n- Gather feedback\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Low Risk\n- ✅ PostGIS is backward compatible with PostgreSQL\n- ✅ Docker Compose already uses this approach\n- ✅ Readiness checks prevent race conditions\n\n### Medium Risk\n- ⚠️ Image size slightly larger (~50MB)\n- ⚠️ Regex for URL parsing could fail on edge cases\n- **Mitigation**: Test with various DATABASE_URL formats\n\n### High Risk\n- None identified\n\n## Rollback Plan\n\nIf issues occur:\n\n1. **Revert K8s template**:\n   ```bash\n   git revert \u003ccommit-hash\u003e\n   kubectl apply -f claude-sandbox/k8s/job-template.yaml\n   ```\n\n2. **Revert entrypoint.sh**:\n   ```bash\n   git revert \u003ccommit-hash\u003e\n   # Rebuild and push image\n   ```\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- [ ] Projects with postgis adapter work in K8s\n- [ ] Projects with postgresql adapter continue working\n- [ ] No database race conditions in logs\n- [ ] Database ready within 5 seconds (typical case)\n- [ ] Proper error messages if database fails\n- [ ] All tests pass\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis implementation addresses:\n- ✅ `.claude-l86` - PostGIS support (main feature)\n- ✅ `.claude-9ba` - Database readiness check\n- ✅ `.claude-sto` - Redis readiness check\n- ✅ `.claude-p6j` - Hardcoded database name (uses ${DATABASE_NAME} variable)\n\n## Timeline Estimate\n\n- Step 1 (K8s template): 10 minutes\n- Step 2 (DB readiness): 20 minutes\n- Step 3 (Redis readiness): 10 minutes\n- Step 4 (Adapter detection): 10 minutes\n- Step 5 (Documentation): 15 minutes\n- Testing: 30 minutes\n\n**Total**: ~1.5 hours\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Review this plan with team/user\n2. Get approval to proceed\n3. Start with Step 1 (K8s template update)\n4. Test each step before moving to next\n5.
